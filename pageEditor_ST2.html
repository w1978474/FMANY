                    <hr>
                    A home page is the main web page that a visitor will view when they navigate to a website via a search engine, and it may also function as a landing page to attract visitors. In some cases, the home page is a site directory, particularly when a website has multiple home pages. <br>

                    <h3><strong>Feedback</strong></h3>
                    <hr>
                    Feedback occurs when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as part of a chain of cause-and-effect that forms a circuit or loop. The system can then be said to feed back into itself.<br>

                    <hr>
                    In this page we can find some general information about the discrimination towrds women throughout their life.<br>

                    <h3><strong>Page Editor - Student 2</strong></h3>
                    <hr>
                    The page editor is a page that describes in a few words what was done in the website.
                    For example, my role as student 2 was to create and develop the homepage, the feedback form, the content page realated to WHO's life cycle typology and the page editor.
